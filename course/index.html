            All modern websites and web applications are built using three <em>fundamental</em> technologies: HTML, CSS
            and
            JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.
        </p>

        <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about, and why you too should learn it.</p>
        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
            <strong>L</strong>anguage.
            It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage(not a
            programming language)
        </p>

        <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images,
            v√≠deo,
            etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>


        <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts: </p>

        <ol type="1" start="1">
            <li> The opening ta
            <li> The closing tag
            <li> The actual element
        </ol>

        <p>Tou can learn more at the
            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" target="_blank">MDN web Docs</a>
        </p>

        <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

        <p>There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them: </p>

        <ul>
            <li> To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
            <li>To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relyng on tools like Worpress or Wix
            <li> To build web applications
            <li>To impress friends
            <li>To have fun
        </ul>
        <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
